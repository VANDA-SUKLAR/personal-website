Welcome to my website! I'm Vanda, a UCLA undergrad majoring in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Mathematics, set to graduate in December 2024. Here, you'll find my academic background and [Resume](/Resume.pdf"Resume").

Off-campus, I enjoy time with Latte, my adorable 12-year-old Shorkie - She's featured in my profile picture!

Connect with me through GitHub, LinkedIn, or email, all linked here. Whether it's about data science or sharing pet stories, I'm excited to engage!
